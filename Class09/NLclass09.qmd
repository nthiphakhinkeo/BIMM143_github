The main database for structural data is called the PBD (Protein Data Bank). Let's see what it contains:

Data from: https://www.rcsb.com/stats


Read this into R
```{r}
pdbdb <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

and answer the following questions:

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbdb$Total
```

I need to remove the comma and convert to numeric to do math:
```{r}
as.numeric( sub(",","", pdbdb$Total) )
```

I could turn this into a function to fix the whole table or any future table I read like this:

```{r}
x <- pdbdb$Total
as.numeric( sub(",","",x))
```

```{r}
comma2numeric <- function(x) {
  as.numeric( sub(",","", x))
}
```

Test it
```{r}
comma2numeric(pdbdb$X.ray)
```

```{r}
apply(pdbdb, 2, comma2numeric)
```

## Or try a different read/import function:

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbdb <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$Total)
```

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$`X-ray`)/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$EM)/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbdb$Total[1]/ sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

## Mol*

Mol* (pronounced "molstar") is a new web-based molecular viewer than we will need to learn the basics of here.

https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will use PDB code: 1HSG

Some more custom images:

![The all important catalytic ASP25 amino acids](1HSG2.png)

![Surface display showing Merk compound in the peptide binding pocket](1HSG3.png)

![Close up view of binding site with drug and HOH 308](1HSG4.png)

## The Bio3D package

The bio3d package allows us to do all sorts of structural bioinformatics work in R.

Let's start with how it can read these PDB files:

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```


> Q7. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

```{r}
sum(pdb$calpha)
```


```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

HOH and MK1

> Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions - i.e. the movements that one of these molecules needs to make to do its stuff

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexibility prediction 
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```

Write out multi-model PDB file that we can use to make an animation of the predicted motions.
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk.pdb")
```

I can open this in Mol* to play the trajectory...
